## Basic HTTP Parser
I wanted to learn more about how HTTP worked. Most of the stuff actually used packages it up really nicely so it is easy to go through life nto exaclty knowing what is going on under the hood.\

The module on codecrafters.io was a great start for this, if anyone reading is interested. Great walk through of the basic HTTP messaging protocol. The purpose of this is to build a standalone basic http server.
